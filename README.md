# Markdown Editor - React

## Introduction

Here, I have created Markdown editor where one can add Markdown Content and see the converted HTML result. You can add headings, images, paragraphs, lists and more. There are two screens, one is the editor and the other displays the result. On mobile view you can either select the editor area or the result area by clicking on the editor or result buttons. The entered data will be automatically saved to Local Storage. The project is fully responsive and tested on different devices.
